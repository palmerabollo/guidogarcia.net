This is my presentation (spanish) about [evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation) for the TEFcon 2014. It was a talk about how we code and how genetic algorithms and genetic programming might help us. Because "programming should be more about the what and less about the how".

Edit: I've pushed the Java code for the [queens problem using genetic algorithms](https://github.com/palmerabollo/genetic-queens) to github.
