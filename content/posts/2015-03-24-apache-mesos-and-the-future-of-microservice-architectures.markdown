Here you have a presentation Apache Mesos, Marathon and [Flock](https://github.com/flock-cloud/flock-docs) I gave for the cloud community in Telefónica.

[Flock](https://github.com/flock-cloud/flock-docs) is an unstable proof of concept I've been working on lately. It is a next-generation service platform that uses Marathon to allocate services across a cluster of machines.

I think the time to start caring only about services -not machines- has come. Compute resources should be treated as a commodity. As tap water.
