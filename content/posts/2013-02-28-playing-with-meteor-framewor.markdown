I have been playing around with [meteor](http://meteor.com), an open-source platform for building web apps. The result is a [200 LOC game ladder](https://github.com/palmerabollo/game-ladder) with a [live demo](http://ladder.meteor.com).

The platform is built on top of nodejs, what is great. In my opinion, it is not yet ready for production environments, but I am really impressed with how fast you can create simple web applications with live page updates, automatic data synchronization and many other niceties I have never seen before in any other web framework.



### ELO algorithm



There is an [open issue](https://github.com/palmerabollo/game-ladder/issues/1) with the ranking algorithm. I am looking for a javascript implementation of the ELO algorithm. I am waiting for your pull requests!
