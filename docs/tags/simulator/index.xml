      <description>A week ago I wrote a post about a Javascript robotics simulator. As an experimental project, I took the opportunity to try different technologies: HTML5, Javascript and Git. In this post I am going to write about what I have learnt with this project from a technical point of view, and what the future lines of work could be.
HTML5 I learnt how the new slider input works, and how to use a canvas to display graphical information into a web browser.</description>

      <description>I must admit I have always been fascinated about robotics, especially about how a swarm of robots can cooperate, following a set of simple rules that lead to complex emergent behaviours, like those you can see in the exciting motion of a flock of birds.
Whereas I have some elctronics background, the bad news is that I am a software developer at heart. This is why I find a big obstacle when it comes to the hardware layer.</description>
