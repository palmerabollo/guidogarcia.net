      <description>For those who are not familiar with it, Spring Roo is an open source tool that provides rapid application development of Java applications, using standard Java technologies underneath.
Last week I gave a presentation (slides) about how to start using Spring Roo to some co-workers in Telef√≥nica Digital. I have recorded a video with captions for those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t attend (use fullscreen mode and 720p).
The video does not cover some interesting aspects about Spring such as Spring Data (I will write a post about it), or how to completely remove Spring Roo from your project (right button &amp;gt; Refactor &amp;gt; Push In and that is all).</description>
