To ORM or not to ORM

</title></head><body>

<div class="section" id="title">To ORM or not to ORM</div>

<div class="section" id="content">

<p>In the last days I have had a couple of interesting discussions about wether to include an ORM library (such as Hibernate JPA implementation) in an application is a good idea or not.</p>

<p>In this case, as usual, I think there is not a single best choice for every scenario, so I&rsquo;ll try to list pros (and cons) for each alternative.</p>

<h2 id="use-an-orm-layer">Use an ORM layer</h2>

<pre><code>  * Easy to develop and maintain. You only annotate your domain model classes with standard JPA/JDO annotations that, at the same time, serve as some kind of documentation. So you can write less code, which means more productivity and probably less bugs.
  * Database independence. You can change your DBMS (i.e. from MySQL to Oracle) and keep you code untouched. Sounds interesting, but I have to admit that I've not seen this need in more than 10 years of professional experience.
  * State management. Automatic synchronization of the state of your in-memory [domain model](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html) with a relational database
</code></pre>

<p>I could say this would be my default choice in a new project without any special requirements.</p>

<h2 id="use-plain-jdbc">Use plain JDBC</h2>

<pre><code>  * Greater degree of control, because you write your own SQL sentences by hand
  * A shallow learning curve (if you already know SQL)
  * More efficient because you can only retrieve the data you need and because you (or a DBA) can fine-tune the precise SQL sentences. I don't fully agree with this argument because an ORM layer also includes many other improvements such as caching, lazy loading, etc.
  * At the end, you also have to write sentences if you use an ORM (i.e. JPQL with JPA)
</code></pre>

<p>I only recommend this alternative in those few cases where you have extreme performance requirements and/or an experienced DBA in your team.</p>

<h2 id="use-a-mixed-model">Use a mixed model</h2>

<p>Some years ago I used iBatis (now <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/">mybatis</a> as a SQL mapping framework that comes with a great documentation and other niceties such as caching mechanisms, ability to build dynamic queries on the fly, etc.</p>

<p>It was great, but at the end you were forced to maintain a XML file with a bunch of SQL queries and the mappings between your classes and your database structure. With mybatis 3 things seem to have changed: you can stop using an external XML file and use Java annotations instead. They are not standard as far as I know.</p>

<p>I have no experience with it, so I don&rsquo;t really know wether it is a valid alternative or not.</p>

<p><strong>Extra point</strong>: One of my coworkers said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ever let hibernate to create your database schema&rdquo;.  Literally. Do you have any reason to think it is not a good idea?</p>

<p>The post is open to any contribution.</p>
