This blog is two years old, and I'd like to share how its >50K visits are distributed.

[![Long Tail](http://guidogarcia.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-23-at-07.54.01.png)

One [single post](http://guidogarcia.net/blog/2012/03/02/how-to-develop-java-rest-client/) drives 40% of the traffic to the blog. At the bottom, 70% of its posts represent 4% of the traffic.

In my opinion, the most popular ones are not the best ones. They are about very specific technical subjects, containing keywords in the title and in the URL slug. Google does the rest.
